Project Components
1. CodeGenerationAgent

    Location: agents/code_generation_agent.py
    Function: Uses the LLM (via Ollama) to generate Python code based on the user's natural language query.
    Key Method:
        generate_code(query): Takes a user query and returns the generated code as a string.

2. ExecutionAgent

    Location: agents/execution_agent.py
    Function: Executes the code generated by the CodeGenerationAgent in a secure environment.
    Key Method:
        execute(code_str): Executes the provided code string and captures the output.

3. SynthesisAgent

    Location: agents/synthesis_agent.py
    Function: Processes the execution output and prepares the final result to present to the user.
    Key Method:
        synthesize(execution_output): Processes execution output to generate a summary.

4. DynamicWorkflow

    Location: workflows/dynamic_workflow.py
    Function: Manages the workflow using LangGraph, orchestrating the interactions between agents.
    Key Methods:
        build_workflow(): Defines the workflow nodes and edges.
        execute_workflow(): Executes the workflow and returns the final result.

5. Main Script

    Location: main.py
    Function: Entry point of the application. Takes the user query, initializes the workflow, and outputs the result.

How It Works
Data Flow and Component Interaction

    User Input
        The user provides a natural language query.
        Example: "Identify all swimming pools in Los Angeles and provide a map and summary report."

    Code Generation
        The CodeGenerationAgent receives the query and generates corresponding Python code using the LLM.

    Workflow Management
        The DynamicWorkflow class uses LangGraph to define the sequence of operations among agents.

    Code Execution
        The ExecutionAgent executes the generated code securely.
        The code may interact with geospatial tools like Prithvi to perform analysis.

    Result Synthesis
        The SynthesisAgent processes the execution output to create a summary or final result.

    Output to User
        The final result is displayed to the user, including any generated files like maps or reports.

Component Interactions

    User → CodeGenerationAgent: User provides a query.
    CodeGenerationAgent → LLM (Ollama): Generates code based on the query.
    CodeGenerationAgent → ExecutionAgent: Passes the generated code for execution.
    ExecutionAgent → SynthesisAgent: Provides execution output for synthesis.
    SynthesisAgent → User: Presents the final result.
